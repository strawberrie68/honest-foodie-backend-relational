## üç¶ What is Honest Foodie?

![Honest Foodie](https://github.com/strawberrie68/Honest-Foodie-front2/assets/42231000/52deeb0d-7f5f-454e-a31a-8e279c899705)



Honest Foodie is a web-based app that **fights bad recipes** 
that can be found in the online space. Instead on this platform
users can review recipes from other social media platforms and 
find what recipes not only look good but taste good as well.

## üë©‚Äçüíª How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** Tailwind, React, Redux, MongoDB

- Frontend - Used React to help create the UI components, tailwind [<kbd><img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/527/527589.png" height="12px" /> R E P O </kbd>](https://github.com/strawberrie68/Honest-Foodie-front2)

## üè∏ Optimizations

- Able to search for recipes optimally - ideally implement Elasticsearch
- Create a better algorithm for detecting what is trending, popular

## üîç Discoveries

The Honest Foodie website is still under development, and we're working on a lot of things at the moment. I recently changed the backend from MongoDB to a relational database using Prisma and Postgres and it was life changing. 

### My Journey of Switching Databases

When I first started developing my project, I used MongoDB as my primary database. While it seemed flexible at first, I quickly encountered significant challenges that made my development process increasingly complex.

#### Challenges with MongoDB

With MongoDB, I found myself constantly struggling with data retrieval and relationships:
- Fetching related data often required grabbing multiple document objects
- Complex queries, especially for features like retrieving top or popular posts, became extremely difficult
- I was forced to perform extensive client-side filtering and aggregation

#### The Breakthrough: Relational Databases

Switching to Prisma with PostgreSQL was a game-changing decision. The relational database model brought clarity and simplicity to my data management:
- Relationships between data became intuitive and easy to define
- Adding related data or performing joins became straightforward with just an additional line of code
- Query performance improved significantly
- The strongly typed schema provided by Prisma added an extra layer of data integrity

#### Key Lessons Learned

- Database choice dramatically impacts application architecture
- Relational databases can provide more structured and efficient data management
- ORMs like Prisma can simplify database interactions while maintaining type safety

### Conclusion

This migration wasn't just a technical change‚Äîit was a fundamental improvement in how I approach data modeling and application design. For anyone facing similar challenges with document databases, I highly recommend exploring relational databases and modern ORMs.
